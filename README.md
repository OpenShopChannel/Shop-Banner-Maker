# Shop-Banner-Maker
This tool will make the dynamic banner used for the Wii Shop Channel icon.

[Wiimms SZS Tools](https://szs.wiimm.de/) is required for converting PNGs to TPLs.

This script needs 4 messages and images for the dynamic banner. Define them in config.json. Confused? Look at config.json.example (it's pretty straightforward).

It's required to WC24 encrypt the output file. [Take a look at the script to do that here.](https://github.com/RiiConnect24/File-Maker/blob/master/Tools/Sign_Encrypt/sign_encrypt.py)
